**Twenty-Four**

The 24 Game is an arithmetical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24.

In this game, 4 cards are randomly picked from a standard deck of 52 cards. 

We will use the values of these 4 cards and a combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses to produce the value 24. 

Note that each of the 4 cards can only be used once.

For the purposes of this assignment, we will consider the following to be the face values of each card in a suit:

“A”: 1 

“2”: 2 

“3”: 3 

“4”: 4

“5”: 5 

“6”: 6 

“7”: 7 

“8”: 8 

“9”: 9 

“10”: 10

“J”: 11 

“Q”: 12 

“K”: 13
